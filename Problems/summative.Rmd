## Problem 1: Conceptual Foundations (15%)

In your own words, answer the following:

1. Explain the difference between using regression for *description*, *prediction*, and *causal inference*. Provide a political science example for each.
2. What does it mean for OLS to be the "Best Linear Unbiased Estimator" (BLUE)? Under what assumptions does this hold?
3. Describe two ways in which omitted variable bias can threaten causal claims in political science. Give an example from a real or hypothetical study.

## Problem 2: OLS Proofs (15%)

Consider the simple linear regression model:

\[
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \varepsilon_i
\]

where \(\varepsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)\).

1. What are the conditions needed for this model to be unbiased, consistent, the best linear unbiased estimator, and the best unbiased estimator? 
2. Explain in words what the Gauss-Markov theorem guarantees about the OLS estimator in this context.

## Problem 3: Multiple Regression & Interpretation (20%)

For the remainder, you may use data and a research problem of your choice, or rely on the one provided below. If you use your own, please briefly explain it.

Use the `states` dataset provided in the `poliscidata` package, which contains state-level political and demographic variables.

```{r load-data}
library(poliscidata)
data("states")

# Variables include:
# vep12_turnout: voter turnout rate in 2012
# uninsured_pct: % without health insurance
# college: % with college degree
# prcapinc: per capita income
# cig_tax: tax rate on cigarettes
```

1. Estimate a linear model where `turnout` is the dependent variable and `uninsued_pct`, `college`, and `cig_tax` are independent variables.
2. Interpret each coefficient in substantive terms. How would you explain the relationship between income and turnout to a non-technical audience?
3. Assess multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs). Discuss whether it is a concern here.

---

## Problem 4: Diagnostics & Model Fit (20%)

Using the model from Problem 3:

1. Produce and interpret the following diagnostic plots:
   - Residuals vs. Fitted
   - Q-Q plot of residuals
   - Scale-Location plot
2. Conduct a Breusch-Pagan test for heteroskedasticity. If present, re-estimate the model with robust standard errors using `sandwich` and `lmtest`.
3. Compare the model fit (using `broom::glance`) before and after adjusting for heteroskedasticity. What changes?

---

## Problem 5: Interactions & Nonlinearity (15%)

Political scientists often argue that the effects of economic and educational inequalities on turnout aren't linear.

1. Test whether there should be nonlinear transformations of `uninsured_pct` and `college` in your model from Problem 3.
2. Interpret any nonlinear transformations you add using:
   - The coefficient table
   - Relevant plots (using `ggeffects` or `margins`)

---

## Problem 6: Communicating Results (15%)

Prepare a publication-quality regression table and figure.

1. Create a table (using `modelsummary`, `stargazer`, `gt`, or `kableExtra`) that displays:
   - The model from Problem 3 (without nonlinarity)
   - Any changes to the model from Problem 5 (potentially with nonlinearity)
   - Include robust standard errors in parentheses.
2. Create a professional scatterplot with a regression line (using `ggplot2`) showing the relationship between `uninsured_pct` and `college.`
3. Write a short abstract (≤150 words) summarizing one key finding from your analysis, as if for a political science journal.
