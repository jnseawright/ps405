    -   This is available for some kinds of low-risk surveys,
        interviews, and observation-based research

---
### Kinds of IRB Review

-   Exempt review

    -   It is also available for some kinds of low-risk experiments,
        involving benign behavioral interventions in conjunction with
        the collection of information from an adult subject through
        verbal or written responses (including data entry) or
        audiovisual recording if the subject prospectively agrees to the
        intervention and information collection
